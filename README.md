# Instabug Backend Challenge

It’s required to build a chat system. The system should allow creating new applications where
each application will have a token(generated by the system) and a name(provided by the client).
The token is the identifier that devices use to send chats to that application.
Each application can have many chats. a chat should have a number. Numbering of chats in
each application starts from 1 and no 2 chats in the same application may have the same
number. The number of the chat should be returned in the chat creation request. A chat
contains messages and messages have numbers that start from 1 for each chat. The number of
the message should also be returned in the message creation request. The client should never
see the ID of any of the entities. The client identifies the application by its token and the chat by
its number along with the application token.
Add an endpoint for searching through messages of a specific chat. It should be able to partially
match messages’ bodies. You must use ElasticSearch for this.
The applications table should contain a column called chats_count that contains the number of
chats for this application. Similarly, the chats table should contain a column called
messages_count that contains the number of messages in this chat. These columns don’t have
to be live. However, they shouldn’t be lagging more than 1 hour.
Assume that the system is to receive many requests. It might be running on multiple servers in
parallel and thus multiple requests may be processed concurrently. Make sure to handle race
conditions. Try to minimize the queries and avoid writing directly to MySQL while serving the
requests(especially for the chats and messages creation endpoints). You can use a queuing
system to achieve that. It is allowed for chats and messages to take time to be persisted. You
should optimize your tables by adding appropriate indices.
Your app should be containerized. We should only write `docker-compose up` to run the whole
stack.
Notes:
● You’re only asked to build the API. No GUI is required.
● You should use Ruby on Rails(V5 or any latest version) for building the API and the
workers. BONUS: You are encouraged to have the endpoints of chats and messages
creation as a Golang app.
● The endpoints should be RESTful. You should provide endpoints for creating, updating
and reading applications, chats that belong to a specific application(GET
/applications/[application_token]/chats) and messages that belong to a specific chat.
Make sure to have appropriate indices in place for these endpoints to be optimized.
● Use MySQL as your main datastore. You’re allowed to use any other component you
need along with MySQL. You may want to check out REDIS.
● You should add a Readme containing instructions to run your code.
● BONUS: Write specs for your code.



# Instabug Chat API


This project implements a RESTful API for a chat system, as specified in the Instabug Backend Challenge. It uses Ruby on Rails for the main API and (optionally) Golang for handling chat/message creation.


## Features


* **Application Management:** Create, retrieve, and update applications.
* **Chat Management:** Create and retrieve chats within applications.
* **Message Management:** Create and retrieve messages within chats.
* **Message Search:** Search for messages within a chat using Elasticsearch.
* **Background Jobs:** Handles chat/message creation and counter updates asynchronously.
* **Concurrency Handling:** Mitigates race conditions in chat/message number generation.
* **Containerization:** Uses Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.


## Technology Stack


* **Backend:**
    * Ruby on Rails (API)
* **Database:**
    * MySQL (Primary data store)
    * Elasticsearch (Message search)
    * Redis (Optional, for caching and background job queues)
* **Containerization:** Docker Compose


## Prerequisites


* Docker
* Docker Compose


## Setup


1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd instabug-chat-api
2. **Start the Services:**


    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This command will:


    Download and build the necessary Docker images (Rails API, MySQL, Elasticsearch, and potentially Redis if used).
    Create and start containers for each service.
    Link the containers together so they can communicate.
    The first time you run this command, it might take a while to download and build the images. Subsequent runs will be much faster.




Base URL
http://localhost:3000
Endpoints


```bash
Applications:


POST /applications (Create an application)
GET /applications/:token (Get an application)
PUT /applications/:token (Update an application)
GET /applications/:token/chats (List chats for an application)
```
```bash
Chats:


POST /applications/:token/chats (Create a chat)
GET /applications/:token/chats/:number (Get a chat)
GET /applications/:token/chats/:number/messages (List messages for a chat)
```
```bash
Messages:


POST /applications/:token/chats/:number/messages (Create a message)
GET /applications/:token/chats/:number/messages/:number (Get a message)
GET /applications/:token/chats/:number/messages/search?query=<search_term> (Search messages)
```
Testing
Run the test suite with RSpec:


```bash
docker-compose run web rspec
```


## Notes
- used for the development & testing environments 
  - wsl2 -> ubuntu 
  - postman
  - docker desktop 

- prior knowledge about .net core apis framework helped with understanding the general architecture of the framework  
- you can test using postman and import the `Instabug Challenge.postman_collection.json` file

## Technical Feedback:

### Race conditions:
- Feedback: Didn't handle concurrency related issues. Hint: There is a race condition in chat/message number generation which might cause the generation of duplicate numbers.
- Recommendations: Needs to think about having concurrency in their application and how to handle the issues resulting from that, such as race conditions. We would recommend to get a more hands on experience with concurrent applications and learn about common concurrency patterns.

### Unoptimzied database:

#### No indexes:
- Feedback: Candidate didn't optimize their database schema for all recurring query patterns. Hint: some of the queried columns are not indexed and thus queries will not be efficient.
- Recommendations: Needs to learn more about indexing and how to use it to optimize performance. We would recommend to read "Indexing for High Performance" from "High Performance MySQL". A summary of this chapter can be found here: https://sayedalesawy.hashnode.dev/high-performance-mysql-ch5-indexing-for-high-performance. A summarized series of the book can be found here: https://sayedalesawy.hashnode.dev/series/high-performance-mysql

#### No unique indexes:
- Feedback: Candidate didn't enforce uniqueness constraints in their database schema for all usecases and their application is prone to duplication.
- Recommendations: Go back to the task definition and spot the unique constraints and how to enforce them from the database side.

### Elasticsearch:

#### Unopitmized query/index:
- Feedback: Candidate didn't use the most suitable way for partial matching regarding performance.
- Recommendations: We would recommend to check the elasticsearch ngram tokenizer, here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-ngram-tokenizer.html

#### Insecure query:
- Feedback: Candidate didn't satisfy the requirements of the partial matching query. Hint: query might return messages that a user doesn't have access to.
- Recommendations: We would recommend to try tweaking the query to scope search on only messages that a given user can access.

#### Unoptimized updates to chats count and messages count:
- Feedback: Candidate's way of updating chats count and messages count causes too much database load. Hint: Updates are done with every new chat/message.
- Recommendations: We would recommend that the candidates re-reviews the task requirement, specially the part relating to not having to have those counts to be real time and think of how to use that to do more lighter updates of those fields. Hint: cronjobs.
